# Jenkins Pipeline for Application Deployment
This Jenkins pipeline automates the build, Dockerization, pushing to Docker Hub, pulling from Docker Hub, and deployment of an application on an OpenShift Cluster within your namespace.
# Overview
The primary objective of this pipeline is to optimize the deployment workflow for Java web applications onto an OpenShift Cluster. By streamlining this process, the pipeline aims to enhance consistency, reliability, and efficiency throughout the deployment lifecycle. Through automation and standardized procedures, the pipeline seeks to minimize errors, reduce deployment time, and ensure seamless application delivery onto the OpenShift Cluster.
# Prerequisites
Before running this pipeline, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
 - Jenkins installed and configured with necessary plugins
 - Docker Hub account with appropriate credentials configured in Jenkins
 - OpenShift Cluster access with credentials configured in Jenkins
 - Maven or Gradle for building the application
 - Docker installed on the Jenkins server
# Pipeline Steps
1. Build: Builds the application using Maven or Gradle.
2. Dockerize: Creates a Docker image for the application.
3. Push to Docker Hub: Pushes the Docker image to a Docker Hub repository.
4. Pull from Docker Hub: Pulls the Docker image from Docker Hub.
5. Deploy to OpenShift: Deploys the application on an OpenShift Cluster within your namespace.
# Usage:
To utilize this Jenkins pipeline, follow these instructions:
1. Begin by creating a new Jenkins pipeline job.
2. Proceed to copy the provided pipeline script (Jenkinsfile) into the pipeline configuration.
3. Configure the required environment variables, including credentials, Docker image name, application name, and OpenShift namespace.
4. Initiate the pipeline either manually or by setting up automatic triggering based on changes in your code repository.


> [!NOTE]
By following these steps, you can efficiently automate your application deployment using Jenkins.
